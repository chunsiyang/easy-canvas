# modules update notification

Canvas could not send notifications to students when their teacher adds or modify an item in modules. 
For students, whos teacher mostly use modules to share learning materials, 
it is a boring routine task to check if there is any update on modules. Therefore, 
using this function you could receive a notification through email or push notification once your teacher updates any learning materials on models.

##### To get notification through Email, you must fill you Email in the profile page in EASY-CANVAS
