    <p>Canvas could not send notifications to students when their teacher adds or modify an item in modules. For students, whos teacher mostly use modules to share learning materials, it is a boring routine task to check if there is any update on modules. Therefore, using this function you could receive a notification through email or push notification once your teacher updates any learning materials on models.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To get notification through Email, you must fill you Email in the profile page in EASY-CANVAS</p>
